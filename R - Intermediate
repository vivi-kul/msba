RELATIONAL OPERATORS

== Equality
!= Inequality
< and > Less than or greater than
=< and >= Less than or equal to, greater than or equal to

We can compare: Logicals, numerics, character strings, logicals with numerics
# Comparison of logicals
TRUE == FALSE
# Comparison of numerics
(-6*14)!=(17-101)
# Comparison of character strings
"user" == "useR"
# Compare a logical with a numeric
TRUE == 1

String comparisons: 
R is case sensitive!!!

All these are TRUE: 
3 == (2 + 1)
"intermediate" != "r"
TRUE != FALSE
"Rchitect" != "rchitect"

All there are FALSE: 
(1 + 2) > 4
"dog" < "Cats"
TRUE <= FALSE


COMPARING VECTORS

Relational operators also work on vectors:

# The linkedin and facebook vectors have already been created for you
  linkedin <- c(16, 9, 13, 5, 2, 17, 14)
  facebook <- c(17, 7, 5, 16, 8, 13, 14)
# Popular days
  linkedin > 15
# Quiet days
  linkedin <= 5
# LinkedIn more popular than Facebook
  linkedin > facebook

COMPARE MATRICES

Relational operators also work on matrices:

# The social data has been created for you
linkedin <- c(16, 9, 13, 5, 2, 17, 14)
facebook <- c(17, 7, 5, 16, 8, 13, 14)
views <- matrix(c(linkedin, facebook), nrow = 2, byrow = TRUE)

# When does views equal 13?
views == 13

# When is views less than or equal to 14?
views <= 14
